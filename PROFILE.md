Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I accepted my first role specialising in data in 2021 and joined my new firm in January 2022. I was responsible for
auditing the firm's data models, evaluating their performance against pre-defined criteria, and contributing to their
periodic updates. I gained new skills progressively until I resigned with a backend data integration patent on 2025 to
join the health sector hosted at a Russell Group university. I hold responsibilities for data cleaning and integration,
pipeline development and maintenance, data analysis and teaching (assistant) on the MSc Health Data Science. I am working
with a small team to generate a causal inference analysis of clinical trials data for a research publication.
